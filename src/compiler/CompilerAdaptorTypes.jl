# CompilerAdaptor — public type aliases.
#
# This file is loaded first so that subsequent files (InferenceDefinition.jl etc.)
# can use the adaptor's opaque names instead of referencing Core.* directly.
# The actual implementations of the adaptor functions live in CompilerAdaptor.jl,
# which is loaded later (after the types from InferenceDefinition.jl are available).
#
# When porting to a future Julia version: if these aliases ever need to point at
# different underlying types, only this file changes.
